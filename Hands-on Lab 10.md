Hi,

For this lab, there are two parts, the Web Site automation testing and GitHub Issues defect tracking.
Please write a combined report, for both of the following, which is at least two pages (700 words) paper with your summary and reflections.
This is a group assignment, so work together with your Study Buddy.
Please turn in one combined report, which includes both students' reflections.
Both students should submit the same report.
The report should state how many hours it took each student (in the reflections sections).

## Web Site Automation
Selenium is a Web Site automation scripting test tool.
Please see this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cobEbkTwbwY) about Selenium.  It is optional, but recommended, to try and run Selenium, as you watch the video.
Try to find another YouTube video which is helpful for learning Selenium and put that into your report.

## GitHub Issues
BugZilla is a defect tracking tool.
GitHub has a feature called Issues, which is also a defect tracking tool.
In this hands-on lab, you will learn and use GitHub Issues.
You will need to sign up for a GitHub account to enter GitHub Defect Issues, which is free.
As you read the documentation and see YouTube videos, you are required to try out creating issues on GitHub.
You can assign the issues to me, Todd Booth.
You can create fictitious Issues against this hands-on assignment repository.

First see this very short [YouTube GitHub Issues Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKJ4RdhyB5Y).
Please review [This GitHub Mastering Issues Web Page](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Please also review [These GitHub Issues Documentation Web Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues).

You will no longer need any of the Amazon AWS instances, so you can delete them all if you want.
Your original AWS $50 USD credits are good until April, 2021, so you can use them after this course is over.

Good Luck, Teacher Todd
